Read the following invoice text and extract the required fields.

Always return in valid JSON format.   
Do not include commas for the number values. For example, 10000 should not be written as 10,000. The format should be strictly json.
Do not put ```json at the beginning or ``` at the end
Do not add any explanation, commentary or extra text.
The output should be just a json format without any explanations or texts.

Extract these fields:
- STYLE# (string of alphabets and digits)
- Color (string)
- Order# (strings of alphabets and digits)
- Location (strings and digits)
- Sizes (integer value of the quantity; sizes may have characters (e.g. 0P, 14W, 16W) but they should be just an integer)
- Total (integer for the total quantites)
- PO ISSUE (a date m/d without zero padding),
- Requested Ship Date (a date m/d/yy without zero padding)
- Inseam size (may be listed in the "description line item comments" after "Product:"; if not, skip)
- Description line item comments (just the product name)
- C Price (float value of the unit price; this is the same for all line items)

Note these facts (do not state this in the output):
- ❌ Order# IS NOT the "Release #". Order# may be followed by different location abbreviations like "AZ1", "GA1", "PL1".
- The STYLE# is the "VENDOR STYLE NUMBER". THIS MUST BE ACCURATE.
- STYLE# should be a combination of letters, numbers, and dashes -.
- The color should be extracted from the description line.
- PO Issue is the PO date.
- DO NOT mistaken quantity as item total. Quantity is the value that comes before EACH.
- Size comes after "Buyers Item Size Description:"
- Sizes may be written as characters. If so, map them to the following integer values: "S" -> 0, "M" -> 2, "L" -> 4, "XL" -> 6
- Location can be found in Location ID, but if there is no Location in Location ID, label as MASTER.
